This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Run the Full Stack Engineer Test

docker-compose up -d --build.

This should run the project in docker container with all the necessary components for the app. I have also included .env file which is not recommended thing to do on github however, I did it just to make everthing easy for you to run the app



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
